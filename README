@DESCRIPTION@

This supports implementing a structure like often seen on blogs
or news message sites with a comment system.

Template changes are needed for this module. Below, you will
find information about the required changes.


Installation instructions:
--------------------------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "@MODULE_ID@" to the
  directory "mods" within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "@TITLE".


Template changes:
-----------------

* Add the thread starting message to read.tpl

  This module will make the thread starting message available on every read
  page through the template variable {THREAD}. Before the {LOOP MESSAGES}
  loop in the read template, you can implement a block of template code for
  displaying the thread starting message, using this variable.

  You can use the same kind of code that is used within the {LOOP MESSAGES}
  loop, but instead of {MESSAGES->somevariable} you can use
  {THREAD->somevariable}.

* Skip the first message in the MESSAGES loop in read.tpl

  The thread starting message is not removed from the MESSAGES template
  variable. Doing so from the module code would confuse the rest of the Phorum
  code, which really likes to see the thread starting message in that array.
  Furthermore, keeping the thread starting message in the array makes it
  possible to apply the template change to only the flat read template
  (read.tpl). The threaded templates will keep working like they did before
  installing this mod.

  Because of the above, you have to implement a bit of code in the read
  template for skipping the thread starting message. The following code will
  take care of this:

  {LOOP MESSAGES}
  +------------ add this code to the start of the MESSAGES loop --------------+
  |   {! Skip the thread starting message. It's handled separately. }         |
  |   {IF NOT MESSAGES->parent_id}<?php continue; ?>{/IF}                     |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      ... original MESSAGES loop code ...
  {/LOOP MESSAGES}
